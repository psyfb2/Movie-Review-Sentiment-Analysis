# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
Machine learning application built with Python and Keras. Sentiment Analysis of movie reviews to predict whether a review is good or bad.
To train the model and run predictions on ad-hoc reviews:
1. Download Python 3.7 alongside Keras 2.3
2. Download 'glove.6B.300d' GloVe embeddings from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ . You can also play around with other embeddings
3. Run the TRAIN function to train the model on the data (.pkl provided for data but can download polarity movie review dataset from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)
4. Evaluate model using EVAL function
5. make new ad-hoc predictions using make_prediction function
