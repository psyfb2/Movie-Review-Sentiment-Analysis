There’s something about a wedding that feels oddly restorative. Symbolically, it’s a new beginning, one in which two families are coming together to form something new, something larger, and, potentially, something stronger than what was before. 
This romantic notion of weddings is not just a modern convention, 
but one which breeds false ideals about what a wedding should be and what should be involved. 
Until the modern era, weddings were no more than business deals in which women were given to suitors as a means of bettering the situation for their parents and siblings. Even the most quintessential object of the wedding process, the engagement ring, didn’t take up space in the collective consciousness until after the Depression when a marketing company helped Da Beers sell the diamonds no one was buying. Though the story crafted by Stephanie Wu and Sara Zandieh, who also serves as director, doesn’t dig into the patriarchal aspects of marriage, the romantic comedy A Simple Wedding does explore the conflict between cultural perceptions of love and the greater significance of philautia, or self-love. It’s in this exploration that Wu and Zandieh’s story takes hold of the mind and grips the heart as the audience goes on a journey that subverts expectations over and over.
